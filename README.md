## 🧱 Project Architecture

This project follows a modern **Lakehouse + AI design pattern** built on Databricks and Azure. Here's the high-level architecture:

- 🔄 **Data Simulation**: Generates both batch and streaming Parquet files
- 🧪 **Ingestion Layer**:
  - Batch → Ingested via PySpark notebooks to Silver layer
  - Streaming → Ingested using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** and stored in Silver
- 🧹 **Transformation Layer**: 
  - Cleansed, validated, enriched in Silver
  - Processed into Gold with analytics-ready columns
- 🤖 **AI Insights Layer**: 
  - Uses **OpenAI GPT-3.5** to summarize Gold data into natural language insights
- 📊 **Visualization Layer**:
  - Real-time Databricks dashboard (sales trends, categories, GPT summary)
- 🔐 **Security Layer**:
  - Azure Key Vault + Secret Scopes for secure mounting and key management
- ⚙️ **Orchestration**:
  - A Unified Databricks Job manages batch, streaming, AI, and dashboard end-to-end

## 🌟 Key Features

This project showcases the most in-demand, real-world features companies expect from modern data engineers:

### ⚙️ Hybrid Ingestion Layer
- 🔄 Simulates **both batch and streaming data**
- ⬅️ Batch data is ingested using PySpark and stored in Bronze (Parquet)
- 🌊 Streaming data is ingested using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**

### 🧹 Multi-Layer Lakehouse Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- 💾 Raw → Cleaned → Enriched data flow using **Delta format**
- 🧠 Gold layer includes reporting-specific columns (total revenue, year/month/day)

### 🧠 AI-Driven Insight Generation
- 🤖 Uses **OpenAI GPT-3.5** to auto-generate sales summaries from Gold layer
- 🔐 API key is secured with **Azure Key Vault + Databricks Secret Scope**
- 💬 Summaries saved to Delta table for real-time dashboard embedding

### 📊 Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
- 📉 Databricks SQL dashboard with:
  - Revenue trends over time
  - Sales by category and store
  - Top 10 best-selling products
  - 🧠 GPT-generated sales summary box

### 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Security

### 🛠️ Additional Notebook

| 📓 Notebook | 📂 Path | ⚙️ Description |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| `01_env_config` | [`real_time_ai_de_project/01_env_config`](real_time_ai_de_project/01_env_config.ipynb) | Mounts ADLS containers securely using **Azure Key Vault + OAuth** |

> 🧪 **Note:** Other notebooks in the repo are for testing/debugging only — not part of the production pipeline.

## 🔐 Secure Access with Azure Key Vault

This project follows security best practices by using **Azure Key Vault** + **Databricks Secret Scopes** to avoid hardcoding any secrets.

### ✅ What We Secured

| 🔑 Secret | 🔒 Stored In | 🔍 Used For |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `adls-client-secret` | Azure Key Vault | Mounting ADLS Gen2 containers securely via OAuth |
| `open-ai-api-key` | Azure Key Vault | Authenticating GPT-3.5 API for AI summaries |

---

### 🧭 How It Works

1. **Azure Key Vault** holds all sensitive secrets
2. A **Databricks Secret Scope** is configured to connect to the Key Vault
3. Secrets are retrieved securely in notebooks via:
```python
dbutils.secrets.get(scope="adls_scope", key="adls-client-secret")

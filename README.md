## 📒 Notebooks Used in the Pipeline

Below are the core notebooks used in the **Unified Workflow Job** — each playing a specific role in ingestion, transformation, AI, and analytics.

| 📓 Notebook | 📂 Path | ⚙️ Description |
|------------|---------|----------------|

| `01_batch_ingestion_bronze_to_silver` | [`03_data_ingestion/01_batch_ingestion_bronze_to_silver`](real_time_ai_de_project/03_data_ingestion/01_batch_ingestion_bronze_to_silver.ipynb) | Ingests and transforms batch data (products, stores, promos, sales) to Silver |
| `01_batch_and_stream_processing` | [`real_time_ai_de_project/01_batch_and_stream_processing`](real_time_ai_de_project/04_gold_layer_creation/01_batch_and_stream_processing.ipynb) | Joins batch & stream Silver data → builds enriched Gold table |
| `02_gold_optimization_and_view` | [`04_gold_layer_creation/02_gold_optimization_and_view`](real_time_ai_de_project/04_gold_layer_creation/02_gold_optimization_and_view.ipynb) | Optimizes Gold layer and prepares SQL views |

### 🛠️ Additional Notebook

| 📓 Notebook | 📂 Path | ⚙️ Description |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| `01_env_config` | [`real_time_ai_de_project/01_env_config`](real_time_ai_de_project/01_env_config.ipynb) | Mounts ADLS containers securely using **Azure Key Vault + OAuth** |

> 🧪 **Note:** Other notebooks in the repo are for testing/debugging only — not part of the production pipeline.


---

## 🔐 Secure Access with Azure Key Vault

This project follows security best practices by using **Azure Key Vault** + **Databricks Secret Scopes** to avoid hardcoding any secrets.

### ✅ What We Secured

| 🔑 Secret | 🔒 Stored In | 🔍 Used For |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `adls-client-secret` | Azure Key Vault | Mounting ADLS Gen2 containers securely via OAuth |
| `open-ai-api-key` | Azure Key Vault | Authenticating GPT-3.5 API for AI summaries |

---

### 🧭 How It Works

1. **Azure Key Vault** holds all sensitive secrets
2. A **Databricks Secret Scope** is configured to connect to the Key Vault
3. Secrets are retrieved securely in notebooks via:
```python   
dbutils.secrets.get(scope="adls_scope", key="adls-client-secret")

```

## 🧩 Workflow Orchestration: Databricks Jobs + DLT

This project is orchestrated using a **Unified Databricks Job** that coordinates batch, streaming, AI, and dashboard tasks in sequence — just like an enterprise-grade data platform.

### 📌 Job: `Unified_Workflow_Job`
![Unified_Workflow_Job](azure_resources_ss/unified_workflow_job.JPG)

This job runs 6 key notebooks in order:

1. `DLT_streaming_data` → Triggers DLT pipeline (`pl_streaming_data_to_silver`)
2. `task_ingest_batch_data` → Ingests batch files to Silver
3. `batch_and_stream_processing` → Joins batch + stream data → writes to Gold
4. `optimize_gold_and_create_view` → Optimizes Gold & builds view for SQL/GPT
5. `gpt_summary` → Sends query results to GPT-3.5 and stores natural language insights
6. `update_dashboard` → Final dashboard update using latest data + GPT summary

📍 You can find the job here:  
[`job_definitions/Unified_Workflow_Job`](job_definitions/unified_workflow_job.json)

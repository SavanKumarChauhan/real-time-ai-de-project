# ⚡ Real-Time AI-Powered Data Engineering Pipeline with Databricks & GPT

This open-source project showcases a **real-time, AI-enhanced data pipeline** built using the **modern Lakehouse architecture** on **Azure Databricks**. It simulates both **batch and streaming data**, processes it through **Bronze → Silver → Gold layers**, integrates **OpenAI’s GPT** to generate smart sales summaries, and finally renders everything in a live **Databricks dashboard**.

> 🚀 Perfect for showcasing Data Engineering, Streaming, GPT Integration, Secure Azure Mounting, and End-to-End Workflow Orchestration skills — just like what modern data teams at tech-forward companies need.

## 🧱 Project Architecture

This project follows a modern **Lakehouse + AI design pattern** built on Databricks and Azure. Here's the high-level architecture:

- 🔄 **Data Simulation**: Generates both batch and streaming Parquet files
- 🧪 **Ingestion Layer**:
  - Batch → Ingested via PySpark notebooks to Silver layer
  - Streaming → Ingested using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** and stored in Silver
- 🧹 **Transformation Layer**: 
  - Cleansed, validated, enriched in Silver
  - Processed into Gold with analytics-ready columns
- 🤖 **AI Insights Layer**: 
  - Uses **OpenAI GPT-3.5** to summarize Gold data into natural language insights
- 📊 **Visualization Layer**:
  - Real-time Databricks dashboard (sales trends, categories, GPT summary)
- 🔐 **Security Layer**:
  - Azure Key Vault + Secret Scopes for secure mounting and key management
- ⚙️ **Orchestration**:
  - A Unified Databricks Job manages batch, streaming, AI, and dashboard end-to-end

## 🌟 Key Features

This project showcases the most in-demand, real-world features companies expect from modern data engineers:

### ⚙️ Hybrid Ingestion Layer
- 🔄 Simulates **both batch and streaming data**
- ⬅️ Batch data is ingested using PySpark and stored in Bronze (Parquet)
- 🌊 Streaming data is ingested using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**

### 🧹 Multi-Layer Lakehouse Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- 💾 Raw → Cleaned → Enriched data flow using **Delta format**
- 🧠 Gold layer includes reporting-specific columns (total revenue, year/month/day)

### 🧠 AI-Driven Insight Generation
- 🤖 Uses **OpenAI GPT-3.5** to auto-generate sales summaries from Gold layer
- 🔐 API key is secured with **Azure Key Vault + Databricks Secret Scope**
- 💬 Summaries saved to Delta table for real-time dashboard embedding

### 📊 Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
- 📉 Databricks SQL dashboard with:
  - Revenue trends over time
  - Sales by category and store
  - Top 10 best-selling products
  - 🧠 GPT-generated sales summary box

### 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Security
- 🔑 OAuth-based mounting via **Azure Key Vault**
- 🧾 Secret scopes hide all credentials and tokens

### 🧩 End-to-End Orchestration
- 🔁 Unified **Databricks Job** executes entire workflow:
  - Batch ingestion
  - Streaming pipeline (DLT)
  - Silver → Gold → GPT → Dashboard
- 🔄 Can be **scheduled or triggered** on demand
